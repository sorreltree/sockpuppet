# sockpuppet
A simple framework for getting started with standalone Puppet

Sockpuppet is designed to be a very simple scaffolding for getting started with
Puppet (http://www.puppetlabs.com/), focused on getting the most basic, common
tasks done while following many of the established practices for Puppet.  The
goal is that a new user should be able to use Sockpuppet to accomplish the most
basic systems tasks in a short amount of time, but should be set up to grow easily
into using more advanced forms of Puppet, including Agent/Master Puppet, External
Node Classifiers, and more complicated Hiera configurations.
